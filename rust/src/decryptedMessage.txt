 
 
The Fox and The Crane 
 
It was long, long ago when the Fox and the Crane were close friends. One fine day the Fox invited the Crane to dinner with her and said to him: 
 
«Come, buddy! Come, my dear! I½ll treat you heartily!Á 
 
And so the Crane came to the Fox for the dinner party. The Fox had cooked semolina for the dinner and smeared it over the plate. Then she served it and treated her guest. 
 
ÀHelp yourself to tasty dinner, my dear godfather. That was me who cooked it!Á 
 
The Crane went peck-peck with his beak, knocked and knocked but couldn½t pick even a bit of fare. The Fox kept licking the cereal until she had eaten it all. 
 
When there½s no cereal at all, the Fox said, 
 
«Don½t feel offended, buddy. There½s nothing more to treat youÁ. 
 
«And thanks hereon, dear,Á the Crane said, Ànow it½s your turn to visit meÁ. 
 
Next day the Fox came, and the Crane made okroshka and poured in into a tall pitcher with a narrow neck and treated the fox. 
 
ÀHelp yourself to tasty dinner, my dear godmother. Honestly, there½s nothing more to entertain youÁ. 
 
The Fox spinned around the pitcher and licked it and sniffed it but couldn½t extract even a drop of the soup. Her head wouldn½t fit the pitcher at all. 
 
Meanwhile the Crane sucked the soup with his long bill. When everything had been eaten, he said to the Fox, 
 
«Don½t feel offended, dear. There½s nothing more to treat youÁ. 
 
The Fox got very angry as she hoped to be full up for the whole week along. So she left empty-handed. 
 
And that was a tit for tat! So, the Fox and the Crane hadn½t been friends anymore since then.
